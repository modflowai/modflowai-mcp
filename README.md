## üéØ What is MODFLOW-AI MCP Server?

MODFLOW-AI MCP Server is a hosted service that provides AI assistants with deep knowledge of groundwater modeling tools. Built on the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), it enables natural language access to technical documentation and modeling workflows.

### Key Features (Alpha)

- **Multi-Repository Search**: Access documentation from MODFLOW 6, PEST++, FloPy, and more
- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask questions in plain English
- **Smart Search**: Both text and semantic search capabilities
- **Modeling Workflows**: Step-by-step guidance for creating groundwater models
- **OAuth Authentication**: Secure access with GitHub or Google accounts

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Join the Waitlist

Visit [www.modflow.ai/login](https://www.modflow.ai/login) to request access. You'll receive configuration instructions via email once approved.

### 2. Compatible AI Assistants

**HTTP Transport** (Direct connection):
- ‚úÖ VS Code
- ‚úÖ Cursor

**MCP-Remote Required**:
- ‚úÖ Claude Desktop
- ‚úÖ Claude.ai (Claude Code)
- ‚úÖ Windsurf

### 3. Configuration

After receiving your access email, configure your AI assistant using the provided endpoint. Detailed instructions are included in the welcome email.

## üìö Available Tools

### Repository Access
- **list_repositories** - View all available documentation sources
- **text_search_repository** - Search for specific terms and functions
- **semantic_search_repository** - Find conceptual explanations
- **get_file_content** - Retrieve specific documentation files

### Model Building (Advanced Users)
- **setup_flopy_workspace** - Configure Python environment
- **download_modflow_executable** - Get MODFLOW executables
- **get_flopy_examples_info** - Access example models
- **download_pestpp_executable** - Get PEST++ for calibration

## üí° Usage Tips

### ‚úÖ Do:
- Focus queries on one repository at a time for best results
- Use specific technical terms when searching (e.g., "WEL package" not "wells")
- Start with `list_repositories` to explore available resources
- Use `get_repository_navigation` before searching (provides repository-specific tips)
- Ask follow-up questions to refine results

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid These (Standard Context Engineering Best Practices):
*These are typical recommendations for any MCP-based tool to ensure optimal results*
- Ask multiple complex questions across different repositories in one query
- Skip the exploration phase if you're new to groundwater modeling
- Expect perfect results for very broad conceptual questions (be specific!)
- Use generic terms when technical terms exist

### üéì Example Queries

**Good Examples:**
- "Search for streamflow routing in mf6"
- "How do I set up particle tracking with MODPATH 7?"
- "Find the obs2obs utility in gwutils"
- "Show me MODFLOW 6 lake package examples"

**Less Effective:**
- "Tell me everything about groundwater modeling"
- "Search all repositories for flow"
- "How does water work?"

## üîç Current Limitations (Alpha)

- **Single Repository Focus**: Best results when querying one repository at a time
- **Search Refinement**: Complex multi-concept searches may need iteration
- **Response Times**: May vary during peak usage or large result sets
- **Documentation Coverage**: Continuously expanding indexed content
- **Platform Support**: Some MCP clients still in testing

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Privacy

- **Complete Privacy**: Your queries are never stored, logged, or accessed by any means
- **Zero Data Retention**: No query history, no response logging, no analytics tracking
- **OAuth 2.0 Authentication**: Secure login via GitHub or Google (only for access control)
- **Read-Only Access**: Cannot modify your data or repositories
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All communications use HTTPS
- **No Third-Party Access**: Your modeling questions remain completely confidential

## üìä Repositories Available

### Code Repositories
- **FloPy** - Python package for creating MODFLOW models
- **pyEMU** - Python tools for uncertainty analysis

### Documentation Repositories
- **MODFLOW 6** - USGS modular groundwater flow model
- **MODFLOW-USG** - Unstructured grid version
- **PEST** - Parameter estimation toolkit
- **PEST++** - Next-generation PEST tools
- **PEST_HP** - High-performance computing version
- **gwutils** - Groundwater utility programs
- **plproc** - Pilot point processor

## üêõ Known Issues (Alpha)

1. **Complex Queries**: Multi-repository searches may return mixed results
2. **Large Results**: Some searches may timeout with extensive matches
3. **Navigation Tool**: Output is for AI use only (not user-friendly)
4. **Platform Differences**: Configuration varies by AI assistant

## üí¨ Feedback & Support

This is an alpha release and we value your input:

- **Report Issues**: Reply to your access email
- **Feature Requests**: Share what would help your workflow
